# HTML Reformatting project

The project I chose to reformat was part of a longer formal report that I did for a technical writing class. 
I chose to include the introduction, methods, and part of the results because those sections contained images and good content that I could make changes to.

In comparison to the Markdown project, this reformatting took me considerably longer.
Having to import each paragraph as its own section with beginning and closing tags was tedious, but not difficult.
I had to make fewer tradeoffs when converting to HTML because there is more freedom in formatting options.
I found myself getting annoyed at VS Code for its automatic tag closure,
as whenever I would type a tag, it would automatically close it after the opening tag, and I would have to manually copy and paste the ending tag to the correct spot.
This did help me to remember to close the tags, but I would rather just type the tag out again than have to copy and paste it.

I wouldn't say I had to sacrifice anything to convert the document to HTML.
I was able to add every element and then some extras. Adding bold and italic text and a list was fun because it was originally a formal report with no fun text.

# Adding CSS styles to an HTML Site

Adding CSS styles to my reformatting project provided a fun way to highlight each element within the website.
The method of making each element a different background color with a unique text color makes it a lot easier to locate where specific elements are.
If I misplaced or overused an element, it will be clearly shown.
I like to use this editing method when editing documents in a word processor to make sure everything looks balanced.
I think CSS is a very satisfying way to add colors and styles, as it is very easy, and it is also satisfying to manually refresh the page and see the effects applied.

If I were to edit the styles simply for aesthetic purposes, I would likely choose a cohesive color theme that adds interest without distracting the reader.
I would put more intention into font choice and heading sizes/colors to enhance readability.

Overall, adding CSS styles to my HTML project was a fun way to both practice HTML and CSS, as well as giving me ideas as to ways to edit webpages in the future.
