<h1>Identifying Factors Influencing Literacy Rates Among Children From Low-Income Families in Rural Minnesota</h1>

<!--INTRODUCTION-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Literacy is a critical skill in today's society.
    Literacy, as defined by Merriam-Webster, simply means the ability to read and write.
    Beyond that, a definition that accurately reflects the complexity of literacy is</p> 
    
    <blockquote><cite>"the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential" (PIAAC, 2013).</cite></blockquote>
   
    <p>Literacy promotes various benefits such as healthier families, safer communities, and increased civic engagement (Barbara Bush Foundation, 2024).</p>

    <p>In the human developmental process, literacy and language development begin long before proper school instruction (Sparks and Reese, 2012).
        Both home life and school instruction play critical roles in literacy development.
        Globally, it has been proven that socioeconomic status (SES) impacts literacy rates and educational achievements among children (UNICEF, 2015).
        Research indicates that lower SES generally indicates lower literacy rates.
        This research seeks to identify the factors that influence literacy development among children from low-income families in rural Minnesota.
        Addressing these factors is highly important for both parents and early childhood educators, as they have a crucial role in shaping literacy development. </p>

<h3>Minnesota's Current State of Literacy</h3>
    <p>Minnesota has seen a general decline in literacy rates of children within the last decade.
        Less than 50% of Minnesota students meet or exceed the NAEP's proficiency standard (Leick, 2024).
        See Figure 1 for trends on reading proficiency trends in Minnesota Schools.</p>

    <p>Students who qualify for free or reduced school lunches are half as likely to meet proficiency standards compared to students from higher-income families (Minnesota Government, 2024).
        Schools with a higher proportion of low-income students consistently score lower in test scores and literacy rates throughout the state (Grunewald and Nash, 2019).
        This gap has only grown over time, with racial and socioeconomic status influencing literacy rates and test scores.
        Figure 2 illustrates the differences between educational proficiency rates and racial and socioeconomic status in Minnesota within the decade.</p>

        </figure>

    <p>There is also a clear need for more recent comprehensive research on the factors contributing to the declining literacy rate in this decade.
        The landscape of early childhood and public education looks different than it did decades ago- it is important to understand the changes and their causes.
        Recent research unanimously agrees that the issue is of great importance, but most research simply states statistics and looks no further.</p>

    <p>The following research question is the basis for this report: <em>What are the barriers impacting literacy rates among children from low-income families in rural Minnesota?</em> 
        Existing literature and empirical research through an interview will be used to answer this question.
        The hypothesis is that</p>

        <ul><li>access to basic life essentials,</li>
        <li>attitudes and education levels of caregivers,</li>
        <li>and access to quality educational materials</li></ul>
        
        <p>impact children's literacy rates.</p>

<!--METHODS-->

<h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>This section will outline the methods used to collect data and conduct research for the report.</p>

<h3>Empirical Research</h3>
    <p>Empirical research was conducted through an interview with an individual who has a connection to the subject matter.
        Elizabeth Roddy is a current faculty member of the <a href="https://hs.wha.k12.mn.us/en-US/staff">Walker public school district located in Walker, MN</a>.
        <!--Add link to her faculty page?-->
        Walker is located in Cass County, with a diverse and majority low-income population.
        She began in Walker 8 years ago as a substitute teacher for social studies classrooms and is currently a Special Education specialist who works with middle school students.
        Roddy was formerly employed by the Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan school district.
        This urban district serves 3 suburbs of St. Paul, MN.
        Her time at both urban and rural school districts gives insight into the differences in literacy.</p>

<h3>Background and Secondary Research</h3>
    <p>Background research and further analysis were conducted via online search through the University of Minnesota Libraries databases.
        Table 2 located in the appendix displays the key search terms used when conducting the research.
        All sources used were deemed credible through their publication within a journal or the institution that published the research/article.</p>

<!--RESULTS-->

<h2>Results</h2>
    <p>This section will be comprised of the results of both primary interviews and secondary online research.
        Table 1 in the appendix provides the interview questions given to E. Roddy.
        Table 2 in the appendix provides the key search terms used for the secondary research.</p>

<h3>Interview Results: E. Roddy</h3>
    <p>Interviewee E. Roddy stated that the state of literacy in rural Minnesota is <strong>"just sad"</strong>.
        She noted that one of the biggest barriers that low-income families face when it comes to children's literacy is parental involvement.
        Many parents from low-income families work several jobs or are in situations in which they don't have a lot of direct interaction with their children.</p>

    <p>Roddy also discussed the differences between teaching at an urban school district versus a rural school district.
        When teaching in Eagan, Minnesota, due dates and strict attendance policies were enforced district-wide.
        Walker school district actively discourages setting due dates for students, and many students just simply do not show up to school with no repercussions. </p>

    <p>When asked about how cultural differences impact attitudes toward literacy,
        she responded that <strong>attitudes within certain cultures impact how children view literacy and much of that responsibility lies on the parents</strong>.
        She has had success stories from every cultural group as well as unengaged children and uninterested parents from every cultural group.
        She states that it is the parents that make the most difference in the lives of their children, mainly in their reading and writing abilities.</p>

    <p>One of Roddy's proudest achievements was when she helped a little boy find a passion for reading.
        During her time as an educator, she had the opportunity to read books from a variety of different authors, cultures, and subjects.
        It is emphasized that “children need books that they can connect to”.
        One of the 6th-grade students was reading at a 3rd-grade level.
        When introducing him to books that reflect his cultural background,
        he was able to go from a 3rd-grade reading level to a 6th-grade reading level in less than a year.
        Roddy highlights that access to diverse and representative books is one of the key factors in children's literacy development.</p>
